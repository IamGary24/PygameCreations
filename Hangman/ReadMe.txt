How to play:
The player will choose a topic from Person, Place, or Thing.
The game will then randomly choose a word from the word bank based on the topic chosen.
The player has 6 guesses to guess the correct word. 
If they are incorrect after 6 guesses the game ends in game over, if they guess the word correctly the game ends in 
congratulations.

What I Learned:
A lot about how robust games can be. Hangman felt easy, but every step posed a new challenge and the game felt like it kept getting bigger and bigger. Also learned a lot about the intricacies of pygame. For example how ticks work, how to better draw to screen and erase what has been drawn. There was also a lot I learned from keyboard input. Also a little bit on how pygame interacts with classes. And as I coded I found I really wanted to be using classes more. From here on out I will be using a lot of classes.

Optimizations:
Outputting stats at the end of the game.
CODE OPTIMIZATION. This code looks ugly.
A play again.
Menu being buttons instead of text interactions as they are now.
