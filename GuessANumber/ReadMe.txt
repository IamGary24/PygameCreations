How to play:
The game will randomly choose a number between -50 and 50. The user will type into the blue
text box to issue a guess, and the game will respond with high, low, or correct.

What I Learned:
The basics of pygame and how text interactions work with pygame.

Optimizations:
Adding a start menu.
Tracking number of guesses.
Tracking number of guesses across all plays and data along with it. (average, mean, etc.)
Animating the text instead of it just appearing.
